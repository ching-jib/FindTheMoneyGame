<b>JavaScript Assessment: Find The Money Game</b>
- I enrolled in a 3 months bootcamp, Junior Full-Stack Developer program, and one of our assessment is to create a Find The Hat Game, using Javascript
- I was not able to complete it back then, but I have revisited the assessment and eventually completed it. Please enjoy the game! :)
